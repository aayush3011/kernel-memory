# Developing with Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB

Integrated Vector Database in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB can be used to seamlessly connect your AI-based applications
with your data that's stored in Azure Cosmos DB. This integration can include apps that you built by using Azure OpenAI
embeddings. The natively integrated vector database enables you to efficiently store, index, and query high-dimensional
vector data that's stored directly in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB vCore, along with the original data from which the
vector data is created. It eliminates the need to transfer your data to alternative vector stores and incur additional
costs.

Please refer to this link for setting up your Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB cluster, and more information on vector
search using [Azure CosmosDB MongoDB vCore](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/mongodb/vcore/vector-search).
